Cybersecurity Projects üõ°Ô∏è

This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity projects and exercises that showcase my work and learning in digital forensics, SOC operations, and security scripting. It brings together hands-on activities, scripts, and documentation related to DFIR, automation, and blue team practices.

üìÇ Contents

Digital Forensics with Autopsy

Case studies using Autopsy for file system analysis.

Recovering deleted files, timeline reconstruction, and artifact extraction.

Reports simulating real-world investigations.

Chain of Custody & Evidence Handling

Documentation templates and practical examples of preserving digital evidence.

Focus on legal and procedural accuracy for forensic investigations.

Acquisition Techniques

Disk and memory acquisition examples using dd, Guymager, and LiME.

Integrity verification with hashing (MD5, SHA1, SHA256).

Python Security Scripts
